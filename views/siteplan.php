        <h2 class="content">Site Purpose</h2><br>
        <p class="content">This site was designed to be a personal website for me to showcase my
        art, and other projects I've created. To fulfill the requirements for CIT336,
        others will be able to create a user and upload there own projects.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2 class="content">Target Audience</h2><br>
        <p class="content">The target audience for this site is anyone who is interested in
        learning more about me or my work. This site will eventually turn into my
        professional online portfolio, so the target audience at that point will
        become potential clients and employers.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2 class="content">Scenarios</h2><br>
        <h3 class="content">Proud Parent</h3>
        <p class="content">Proud Parent is a family member who spends way to much time being 
        interested in my life and what I'm working on. They check up on this site
        often to see what I have been up to and to tear up at the accomplishments of 
        their darling daughter.</p><br><br>
        <h3 class="content">Potential Employer</h3>
        <p class="content">Unlike Proud Parent, Potential Employer is not biased towards
            my abilities and designs. Potential Employer will want to see evidence o
            skill and other accomplishments before contacting, so they will want to
            see a fully functioning website, that is both pleasing to look at and well 
            thought out.</p><br><br>
