<h3>about me, michele v cope</h3>   

    <div id="container">

        <p id="content-about-me"> 
            I was born in Southern California and grew up in Idaho,
            I currently live in Utah with my husband. I love the 
            western United States and the beauty that surrounds me. 
            I love hiking, camping and just being outside. I also 
            love stories and learning new things about the world 
            I live in. I once read a quote by Neil Gaiman, that 
            has changed the way I feel about the world, it said;
            
            <strong>Fairy tales are more than true, not because
            they tell us that dragons exist but because 
            they tell us that dragons can be beaten."</strong> 
            The world has enough darkness in it, I want to make a 
            difference in that! I will always strive to inspire 
            and uplift others through my art.</p>
